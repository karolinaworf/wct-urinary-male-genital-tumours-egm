# Evidence and Gap Map for tumours of the kidney, prostate and urinary tract from the WCT of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours

This repository hosts the interactive HTML of the Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) for renal cell carcinoma, urothelial tumours and glandular neoplasms of the prostate. The map was developed as part of the WCT EVI MAP (https://wct-evi-map.iarc.who.int/) project using EPPI-Reviewer® and EPPI-Mapper®. It provides an accessible overview of the available research evidence across key tumour entities and supports transparent evidence synthesis.

## Accessing the interactive EGM

The interactive version is available at: https://karolinaworf.github.io/wct-urinary-male-genital-tumours-egm/

All files needed to run the EGM locally are included in this repository.
